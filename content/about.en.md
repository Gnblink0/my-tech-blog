HiðŸ™‹ I'm Gina â€” a developer who likes building small things that try to make sense of a complicated world.

I spent years studying how people think, read, and connect as a history major bachelor, which shaped how I see the world. Now, as a MSCS student at Northeastern University, I'm focused on building it.


### _currently, I am_

- pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at Northeastern University, focusing on full-stack and mobile development
- actively seeking **Fall 2025** software dev co-op roles in web/mobile development
- building [**Tomatch**](https://github.com/the-tomato-king/Tomatch), a grocery price tracker powered by AI and Firebase
- improving my system design and backend knowledge through side projects

### _over the past bit, I have_

- built the full stack of Tomatch, including OCR-based price logging, Firestore data storage, and map-based store comparison
- completed a full-stack healthcare appointment system (MERN), featuring role-based access control and analytics dashboard


### _looking ahead, I'd like to_

- finish and publicly launch Tomatch on App Store / Play Store
- explore monetization, maybe accidentally build a real business
- become that person who actually blogs regularly, not just sets up the layout


Thanks for visiting.
